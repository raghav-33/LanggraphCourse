What is HITL?
HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) is a design approach in AI systems where a human actively
participates at critical points of the AI workflow — either to supervise, approve, correct,
or guide the model’s output.

Think of HITL as putting a human “checkpoint” inside an AI pipeline so that important
decisions are not made autonomously by the model.

Why HITL Exists?
(i)To help agentic systems
(ii)To add accountability

HITL ensures:
(i)Accuracy
(ii)Safety
(iii)Ethical alignment
(iv)Better user experience

Common HITL Patterns:
(i)  Action Approval Pattern (Approve / Reject Before Execution).
(ii) Output Review / Edit Pattern.
(iii)Ambiguity Clarification Pattern.
(iv) Escalation Pattern. 

How Implemented ?
(i) interrupt() → pauses the graph and waits for human input.
(ii) Command() → resumes the graph with human-provided state updates.

common code structure we can follow ?
Example 1: Simple Approval
interrupt({
    "type": "approval",
    "message": "Approve this action?",
    "content": state["ai_output"]
})


Example 2: Review + Edit
interrupt({
    "type": "review",
    "ai_output": state["ai_output"],
    "allowed_actions": ["approve", "edit", "reject"],
    "instructions": "Edit if incorrect, otherwise approve"
})

Example 3: Tool Execution Approval

interrupt({
    "type": "tool_confirmation",
    "tool": "delete_user_files",
    "arguments": {"path": "/data"},
    "risk": "HIGH"
})


"content": state["ai_output"] do?
👉 It packages the AI output
👉 and sends it to the human via interrupt()

Think of it as:
“Here is what the AI wants to do — please review it.”
