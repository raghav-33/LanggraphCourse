It is better Way or standarized way to connect tools with LLMs.

Problems of Tools
(i)Our Manger want to integrate Chatbot With Github , so it can read Github repos and answer queries
(ii)But we have 2 types of tool (i) prebuilt and (ii) Custom tools . for custom tool we have to write a code
(iii)LangChain does not provide any prebuilt github integrate tool , so we have to write custom code which is very complex and integrate with api
for this case , or code may break | fail at any time if api change or request limit exceed.
(iv) Basiclly probelm is any changes take place in server side (github tool) affect Client side (LLM)
(iv) This is Biggest Probelem With Tools and MCP Resolve this Problems

What Problem MCP resolve ?
Any changes take place on server side (github tool) does not affect Client side (LLM)
if any change take place at server side we did not need to change any thing at client side.

MCP Code Writing
During Writing of MCP code we have to write code for 2 things 
(i) for MCP server (ii) Mcp Client (used for communication with MCP server)

But in LangChain we can write a code For Constructing MCP server
