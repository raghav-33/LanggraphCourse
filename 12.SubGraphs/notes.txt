Subgraph Become Very imp concept if we want to build multi agent system.

what are Multi agent system?
system where Multiple agent are link in graph through nodes and edges.

What is Subgraph ?
A Subgraph in Langraph Usually means Graphh that is embedded and executed as node inside another Graphh

Why needed?
User -> LLM -> Output

Gen Ai LLMs can be Very complex it can contain lots of Modulue like.
Tool calls
RAG
Conditional routing
Retries
Memory
HITL
Evaluation
Guardrails

What benfit give ?
(i) Modularity : Entire piece of code break into smaller pieces of code
(ii) resuability : reuse subgraph in another graph also.
(iii) Maintainability : increases.

(iv) Failure isolation : if one subgraph fail another work with warnings
(v) state seperation : differnet subgraph will have differnet / seperate state
(vi) Observability : trace seperately every agent / subgraph.
 
way to implement subgraph in langgraph ?
(i) Invoke graph from node : [There is no direct connection b/w both 2 graphs] invoking subgraph from parent graph kai node sai {Both graphs have seperate States}
(ii) Add a Graph as node:  There is  direct connection b/w both 2 graphs] , instead of invoking from parent graph node , directly invoking. {Both graphs have same States}
