Tools : Adding External Tool like Gmail , Duck Duck Go , calculator so LLM can perform action 
using it , when llm think i need to use tool acc to user query.

For Detailed Tool Intro: Watch Langchain Video 16 (Tools)

We want LLM which can perform both Genral Task and Actions
so we our LLM need to understand from user query whether to user is demanding Action or genral chatting

GENRAL LLM WORKFLOW                  TOOLS BASED LLM WORKFLOW
Start                                   start

Chat_Node                               Chat_Node  // WE NEED DECISION MAKING HERE TO DECIDE GENRAL CHATTING OR TOOL CALLING

 |                                       |     |

// WE NEED {DECISION MAKING} AT {Chat_Node} IN TOOL BASED LLM TO DECIDE GENRAL CHATTING OR TOOL CALLING
Concept Come Here is {Tool Node}
> Tool Node : is special kind of Node where we store all tool which need to integrate with genral LLM 
           (ii) Specaility of Tool Node is it automatically decide which tool to call

> Tools Condition : is prebuilt function in langgraph , which is Used in {Chat_Node} and decide automatically from user query to do chatting or tool calling.
