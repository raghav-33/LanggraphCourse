1. full rag is not tracing ,only chain part is tracing
    LangSmith by deafult trace only Langchain Runnables (that part in which {invoke Function} is executing).

    Now See code of file 3_rag_v2 (for tracbles) and file 3_rag_v2 (tracble + metadata)
    what ' used ? Tracebles : with the help of tracebales we can trace any python function. and additional benfit also add metadata


2. Every time when we user make a query , request entire RAG workflow re execute , each time pdf is loading , embeddibg created every time ans so on.
  but acc to good enginerring principle : if once pdf is loaded , embedding is created and stored in vector dbs then this process should not 
  reexecute every time.

  Speed / latency problem

  Now See code of file 3_rag_v4.

Langchain+LangSmith vs Langgraph+LangSmith

1. Langchain+LangSmith
    In the langchain every function is not traced explicity , only that part of code is traced which is runnable(.invoke() function)
    To explicitly Trace every function we uses TRACEBLAES , which trace Runnable and every function
    first we define every function with tracebales then define wrapper which contain all function to trace implicilty
    see code file  3_rag_v2.


2.Langgraph+LangSmith
   In the Langgraph every node which is function is traced implicilty.
   not like langchain problem to trace explicilty

   Other Features of LangSmith

   1. Till Now Discussed : Observability 
    jab ham llm ko ek baar execeute karte hai tu {Trace} form hota hai . jisko ham trace kar sakte hai (jiske andar ham observe kar sakte hai har ek componenet kaise run hoya.)

   2. Monitoring
      ek din mai llm multiple time execute hota hai , hum uski average Observability dek sakhte hai jaise average latency , average token used etc.

    3. Altering : Altering set kar sakte hai jaise latency greater than 7 hoti hai tu team ko alert krdo.
    4. Evaluation
    5. Prompt Experimentation
    7. Dataset Creation and Annotataion
    8. user feedback

    observality : studying single trace
    monitoring : studying multiples Traces
